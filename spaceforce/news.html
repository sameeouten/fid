<h2>Harvest</h2>
<p>This was our first introduction to the covanent. They showed up, sent the message "Your destruction is the will of the Gods and we are their insturment" and proceeded to wipe the planet out.</p>

<h2>The Fall of Reach</h2>
<p>The most recent planet to completly fall to the covanent and only one ship got away.</p>

<h2>Destruction of the first Halo Ring</h2>
<p>The ship that fled Reach discovered this ring. The covanent held it sacred, turns out it was a weapon that could wipe out the entire galaxy. Thankfully it was destroyed but, there are more.</p>

<h2>Innvasion of Earth</h2>
<p>Currently Earth is under attack a small covanent fleet has somehow accidentally appeared above Earth. Right now most of their forces are attacking Africa with a main focus on the city of New Mombasa.</p>
