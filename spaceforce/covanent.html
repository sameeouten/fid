<h2>The covanent are humanites worst enemy. They are a group of aliens who believe that human kind are demons in their religion and want to wipe us all out. There is no negotiating with them. They simply believe we are evil and if not stopped they will kill every man, women, and child until we are extinct as a species. Here are the various memebers of the covanent.</h2>
</center>
<h3>Grunts</h3>
<p><a href="grunt.html"><img src="images/grunt.png" alt="A Grunt" width="200" height="200"></a><br>
<p>These poor saps are the lowest in the covanent. They where forced into joining and are sent out to die as meat shields. However you should not take pity on them as they will stil try to kill you.</p>

<h3>Elites</h3>
<p><a href="elite.html"><img src="images/Elite.png" alt="An elite" width="200" height"200"></a><br>
<p>These guys are the cream of the crop in the covanent. A warrior culture and ten times stronger than the average human. Work together as a team to take them down or they will easily overpower you.</p>

<h3>Jackal</h3>
<p><a href="jackal.html"><img src="images/Jackal.png" alt="A Jackal" width="200" height"200"></a><br>
<p>Pirates and criminals who ended up in the covanent. They don't really believe in most of the religious stuff but, happily take advantage at the chance to kill us. Be extra careful of the snipers for they have better eyesight than any human can dream of.</p>

<h3>Hunter</h3>
<p><a href="hunter.html"><img src="images/hunter.png" alt="A hunter" width="200" height"200"></a><br>
 <p> You may not believe it but, these things are worms operating a suit of armor with a rocket laucher. Highly aggressive and stronger than ten humans. They always come in pairs of two, be warned if you kill one they other will go into a blinding rage and attck anything that moves. </p>

<h3>Brute</h3>
<p>
  <a href="brute.html"><img src="images/brute.png" alt="A brute" width="200" height="200"></a><br>
  <p>These guys are big and dumb but, don't tell that to their face because a simple slap from a brute can knock your head off your spine.</p>

  <h3>Engineer</h3>
  <p><a href="engineer.html"><img src="images/engineer.png" alt="A engineer" width="200" hight"200"></a><br>
    If you thought the grunts did not want to be in the covanent the engineers hate being there. Most of the time the covanent will bully them into using their psychic powers or sometimes strap bombs to them ans send them at us.</p>

    <h3>Drone</h3>
    <p><a href="drone.html"><img src="images/drone.png" alt="a drone" width="200" height="200"></a><br>
   Giant bugs who fly and will often swarm you like locusts.</p>

    <h3>Prophet</h3>
    <p><a href="prophet.html"><img src="images/prophet.png" alt="A Prophet" width="200" height"200"></a><br>
 You will never see these guys in the battle field. They're the puppet masters who pull the strings of the covanent. Everything that has happen to us has been on their orders and we need to stop them.</P>
